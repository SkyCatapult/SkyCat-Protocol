# SkyCat-Protocol
The SkyCat Protocol is a community driven, fair launched DeFi Token.
Three simple functions occur during each trade: Hodlers get a bonus, LP Acquisition, & Burn.
Only 1% of the tokens are held by the team.
50% were irretrievably burned right at the start.
99% of all remaining tokens are available for the community. 
This guarantees a truly uniquely fair distribution.
